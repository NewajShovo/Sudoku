# Sudoku Solver

## What?

Sam's free time project to write a simple Android Sudoku solver. Please bear in mind that I'm: -

1. Not an App developer
2. Not a graphic designer

so please don't judge me too much :-) I know this looks a bit rough! The point was for me to have a play with some fun technologies rather than to produce a polished commercial App.

## How?

The idea is to use: -
* An off-the-shelf OCR library, e.g. Tesseract https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
* A basic backtracking Sudoku solving algorithm https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/Lecture11.pdf

## ToDo

* ~~Work out how to create a basic Android App~~
* ~~Take a picture and show a preview~~
* Get the image from the SD Card
* Analyse the image to get the Sudoku grid
* ~~Solve the puzzle~~
